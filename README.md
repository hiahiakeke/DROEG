# DROEG
Here we develop a novel method for drug response prediction in tumor cell lines by combining genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic data with CRISPR essential genes for cancer cells to create DROEG model (Drug Response based on Omics and Essential Genes),  and reveal that  the effect of tumor proliferation essential genes can improve the drug sensitivity prediction. DROEG integrates literature-based and statistics-based method to select features, and uses SVM for model training and testing.
